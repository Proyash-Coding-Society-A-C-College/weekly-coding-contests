Given an array arr[] of size n, containing elements from the range 1 to n, and each element appears at most twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice.

Note: You can return the elements in any order but the driver code will print them in sorted order.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 1, 2, 3] Output: [2, 3] Explanation: 2 and 3 occur more than once in the given array. Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 2] Output: [] Explanation: There is no repeating element in the array, so the output is empty.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer n, the size of the array. The second line contains n space separated integers representing the array arr[].

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 106 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n

Output Format

For each test case, print all the integers that appear exactly twice in the array.

If no element appears twice, print -1.

Print the result of each test case on a new line.

The output elements will be printed in sorted order (handled by the driver code).
