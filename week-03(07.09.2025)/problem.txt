                                 Problem Given by:Sandeep Roy

You are waiting for a bus that starts from rest at the station, accelerates uniformly, and you want to know how far it has gone after some time.

But there's a condition:

The bus doesn’t always start from rest. Sometimes it already has an initial velocity u

It then accelerates at a constant rate a for t seconds.

Your task is to find the total displacement of the bus after t seconds.

Displacement is given by:

S = u×t + (1/2) a×t^2

Input Format:

Three integers:

u = initial velocity (m/s)

a = acceleration (m/s²)

t = time (s)

Constraints:

0≤u≤100000
-100≤a≤100
1≤t≤100000
Output Format

Print the displacement (in meters), rounded to 2 decimal places

Sample Input 0:

0 2 5
Sample Output 0:

25.00
Sample Input 1:

10 1 4 
Sample Output 1:

48.00
